# Twitter Clone with React and Vite

Welcome to my **Twitter Clone** project, built using **React** and **Vite**! This application is a simple but fully functional clone of Twitter, featuring basic tweet functionalities like posting, liking, retweeting, and replying to tweets.

This project uses **React** for the frontend and **Vite** for fast development with **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**. The application has been structured in a modular way, following best practices to create reusable components for tweets, profiles, and interactions.
